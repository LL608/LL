# Data Visulization 
Followed by Data Reshaping and Preprocessing, we obtained a series of tokenized words. Due to the large amount of data set, it is hard for us to uderstand the underlying trends and patterns. Therefore, the data visulization becomes neccesary. As a part of data visulization, the frequency table and wordclouds are genenarated to tell the story behind the data.   
## Generating Frequency Set 

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for
